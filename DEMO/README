The DEMO folder contains five scripts:

    - filter.py : this is a helper script that does the preprocessing of the 2D svg floor maps. This script filters the files based on user selections done in the interface.

    - get_stroke_widths.py : this is a helper script that assists in filtering and preprocessing the data be getting the widths of the strokes used in the 2D floor maps.

    - multi_2d_to_3d.py : this is a helper script that take the different 2D floor maps (such as floor maps for floors 1-7) and creates a 3D model from them.

    - web_app.py : this is a streamlit application that launches a localhost web UI that can be used to run the demo. In the UI there is the option to upload a directory/folder containing all the 2D svg floor maps. After running in the background the UI will open up Blender with the generated 3D model. The script will also save the output file as output.blend. This file can be exported as a GLB and opened in the display_3d_model.py app.

    - display_3d_model.py : this is another streamlit application that launches a localhost web UI that can be used to view the 3D model in the browser. For this one it is required to upload the GLB file. The web_app.py creates a blend file called output.blend, this file can be exported and viewed in the browser.

REQUIREMENTS:

Blender, various libraries, terminal

TO RUN DEMO:

-- web_app.py -- 

Step 1: To run the demo please open the web_app.py file. Import all dependencies and requirements. Please have Blender downloaded on your computer. In the web_app.py file please enter the path location to your Blender download on your computer in the <run_blender_script> function! Replace this line: "/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender",  # Blender executable with your Blender file location inside the quotations. 

Step 2: Open the terminal. Run the following command: streamlit run <FILE LOCATION OF web_app.py file>. This should open up the streamlit application in your browser. 

Step 3: Follow the directions in the streamlit application in the browser. The first entry should be for the directory path for the 2D svg files, for example: </Users/marius/Documents/GitHub/Junction_Hackathon/Material to share/Site 1/svg_output> 

Step 4: Add the elevator files. These can be found in the Material to share folder under the respective site folders!

Step 5: Press Apply. Then options for chosing stroke width will appear. You can play around with the different options to see what works best, but for demo purposes if you are testing Site 1 please choose 0.3 and 1. For Site 2 please choose 0.25. 

Step 6: Press Process SVGs. This will start running in the background and may take up to a minute. After it is finished it will open Blender automatically on your computer and show the generated 3D model along with the elevator and shaft. 

-- display_3d_model.py -- 

Step 1: Install and import all dependencies. 

Step 2: Run the web_app.py DEMO to generate a output.blend file. This file contains the generated 3D model from the 2D floor plans. Once the web_app.py application opens the Blender window with the generated 3D model, please export the file as GLB format. 

Step 3: Open the Terminal. Run the following command: streamlit run <FILE LOCATION to display_3d_model.py>. For example run streamlit run DEMO/display_3d_model.py

Step 4: This should open the browser application. Once in the app please upload the .GLB file from step 2. It should then open the 3D model visualization in the web based browser! This allows for simple and browser based 3D modeling.
