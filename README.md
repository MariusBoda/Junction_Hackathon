The challenge

Introduction

Our industry is moving towards smarter maintenance with IoT and digital twins, allowing remote operations and real-time 3D visualizations of buildings, equipment, and people. But there’s a big challenge: many older buildings don’t have 3D models or BIMs, which limits the ability to improve maintenance and modernization. This gap slows us down and prevents us from making operations as efficient as they could be. Help us create a 3D BIM and digital twin of any building and its equipment to solve a massive industry-wide problem, drive smarter, faster maintenance and modernization, and open the door to fully connected, future-ready operations.

The challenge

Smart building equipment such as elevator and escalator providers are leveraging the power of IoT data, 3D modeling, and analytics for performance and condition monitoring and reporting in real-time. A big challenge, however, is that the existing solutions are typically detached from the context and do not provide an integrated and dynamic view, e.g., visualizing and monitoring elevator condition with spatial information such as the location of the elevator in the building.

The key challenge is that there is no easy-to-use tool to:

Create a simple and identifiable 3D model of the building based on a limited set of input parameters available such as the building address and/or 2D floor plans, and floor heights
Import, position and orient existing equipment 3D models, especially elevators to the 3D model of the building with drag-and-drop type of process.
Export the model and its components (e.g., equipment) into a standard 3D file format for further processing, e.g., deploying the model as part of a digital twin application.

Insights

We want a maintenance and modernization salesperson to be able to create the initial 3D model of the building into which the elevators and related equipment models will be integrated for a live building twin. Creating the elementary 3D BIM should be easy and fun for anyone with basic computer skills.


What we'll bring

During the event, participants will ideate and in the best case create a prototype of the 3D BIM application using open-source software, tools and technologies. The participants will get access to a GitHub repo containing all the necessary information and data from a couple of use cases with the relevant input parameters to support the development and/or validate ideas and outcomes.

The participants will get support from a team of vertical transportation and people flow experts with long experience in data engineering, advanced analytics, cloud computing and software and product development.

The expected outcome is a prototype that can be taken into pilot use and testing in practice with a minor development and migration effort.

Successful implementation will unlock significant value in the maintenance and modernization services. This is a fantastic opportunity for participants to showcase their talent and innovation in driving sustainable urban growth.


The Prizes

The winner team gets a cash prize of €3000


Judging criteria

Use any open-source software, tools and technology you see fit for the challenge. Preferred technologies include React, Python and Java.

Our team will focus on the following criteria: ease of use (e.g., simple and fast to use) and extensibility/scalability (e.g., the solution can be applied for tens of thousands of customers).
